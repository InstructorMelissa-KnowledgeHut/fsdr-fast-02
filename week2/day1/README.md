Basic Web Architecture

Client Layer - What the end user or General everyday user will interact with and see
Data Layer - The database behind the application
Server Layer - Mostly the scripts that help bring the data to the client
Business Layer - much like the Server layer helps interactions between data and client

Databases
CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
Create - adds new items to database (POST)
Read - Simply returns item(s) from the database to the client layer (GET)
Update - Edits or changes current information in the database (but for only 1 item at a time) (PUT)
Delete - Removes from the database 1 item (DELETE)
